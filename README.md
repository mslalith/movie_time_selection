This is created as a Flutter Web project, so you can play around with the design and help me find bugs.<br>

## Packages:

- provider: ^4.3.2 (State Management)

## Further Optimizations:

It can be achieved using [Slivers](https://medium.com/flutter/slivers-demystified-6ff68ab0296f) (great article by Emily). I initially started to develop with Slivers, but I couldn't offset the Time Selection grid above the [SliverPersistentHeader](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/SliverPersistentHeader-class.html). So I went with using a single Stack.<br>
If this can be achieved using Slivers, please fork this repo and send me PR.
